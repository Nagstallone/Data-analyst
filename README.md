Hello# Data-analyst
In a world so data driven as it is in todayâ€™s world, municipalities must take the step to upgrade their data management and analytics platforms to aid in decision making as well as increasing efficiency while reducing cost. The objective of this project is to engineer and deploy a Data Analytic Platform (DAP) for the City of Vancouver using Amazon Web Services (AWS). Through their migration to AWS, the City gains access to cloud scale, secure and cost effective solutions to process large amounts of data and derive meaningful insights.
As a follow up to Phase 1, the project extends on the foundational data processing and analysis pipelines that were setup. In phase 2, these capabilities are extended with the implementation of the latest data features like Data Enriching, Data Protection, Data Governance and Data Observability. These components instill confidence that the data is in a highly efficient process with a corresponding high degree of accuracy, security and, most important, transparency.
Additionally, the project will assess the DAP against critical and cloud architecture principles, inlcuding Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance efficiency, Cost Optimization, and Sustainability. Through this evaluation, the platform's strengths and areas of improvement will be identified in order to link with the City of Vancouver's strategic goals.
This project joins the power of innovative AWS services with established analytics methodologies to yield a holistic DAP to handle the City's escalating data management requirements. Urban planning, resource allocation and service delivery can be done better in the city using the results.
